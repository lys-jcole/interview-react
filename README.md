# React Coding Interview

## Objective

Build a simple React application based on the requirements below. The goal is to evaluate your ability to structure components, manage state, and write clean, readable code.

## Setup

1. **Make sure you have Node.js installed (v16 or later recommended).**
   You can check with:

   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

   If not installed, download it from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

2. **Clone the repository and navigate into it**

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:lys-jcole/interview-react.git
   cd interview-react
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This should open `http://localhost:3000` in your default browser. If not, you can open it manually.

5. **You're ready to start coding!** Open `src/App.jsx` and begin implementing the challenge.

## Requirements

- [ ] Fetch data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
- [ ] Display the list of users in a responsive layout
- [ ] Include a search box to filter users by name
- [ ] Add a button to sort users alphabetically
- [ ] Use functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect)

## Notes

- You may use any styling method (CSS, Tailwind, etc.)
- Focus on code quality, clarity, and functionality.
- Optional: Add a README explaining your thought process.

Happy coding!
